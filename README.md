Phase 1: Core System Setup

1. Scope and Features
Purpose: A ticketing system usable for both internal IT support and external customer support, with the ability to switch modes.
Key Features:
Ticket creation via web interface and email.
Ticket categorization (e.g., hardware/software) and prioritization (e.g., Low/Medium/High).
Ticket statuses: Open, In Progress, Closed, etc.
Roles and permissions:
Admin: Full control, user management, view all tickets.
Support Agent: Manage assigned tickets.
Regular User: Submit tickets and track their status.
2. Technology Stack
Backend: Python (Flask or Django).
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (simple and responsive, using Bootstrap).
Database: MySQL or Microsoft SQL.
Email Integration: Python libraries (smtplib, imaplib) for handling ticket creation via email.
3. Start Here
Design database schema to support users, tickets, roles, and activity logs.
Build a simple web interface for ticket creation, status updates, and tracking.
Add basic role-based authentication and authorization.

Phase 2: Enhancements and Flexibility
1. Analysis and Reporting
Build a dashboard to display:
Open, closed, and in-progress ticket counts.
Average resolution time and trends.
Agent performance metrics.
Add export functionality for reports (e.g., PDF or Excel).
2. Ticket Tracing
Implement an activity log for tickets (e.g., status changes, comments).
Show ticket history in a detailed view.
3. Scalability
Design APIs for future integration with Microsoft Exchange or other tools.
Plan for Outlook plugin or add-ons to use the ticketing system directly.

Phase 3: Advanced Features (Future)
Advanced dashboards with graphs and analytics.
Integration with other communication tools (e.g., Slack, Microsoft Teams).
Notification system via email/SMS for updates.
From Where to Start:

Create tables for:
Users (ID, Name, Role, Email, Password).
Tickets (ID, Title, Description, Category, Priority, Status, Assigned To, Created Date, Updated Date).
Roles and Permissions.
Activity Logs (Ticket ID, Action, Timestamp, User).

Step 2: Basic Web Interface
A homepage for login and role-based dashboards.
Forms for ticket creation and status updates.
Simple ticket list views for users and support agents.

Step 3: Backend Logic
Implement ticket lifecycle management (create, update, close).
Build APIs for email integration.
